####Questions
>Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Pseudocode is used to get started with an algorithm, to start brainstorming about what you want to do, and to be able to convey ideas to non - programmers.

>If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?


A: nothing, it will not run.



1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT two numbers
If the first number is greater than the second number THEN PRINT the first number
ELSE PRINT the second number


function findHigher(a,b){
if ( a > b){
  return a; 
} else if (b > a ){
  return b;
}
}
findHigher(188,195);


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.


INIT number to 1
FOR IF number < 100, INCREMENT by 1
REPEAT-UNTIL number is 100
ENDFOR

for (let i=1; i <= 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);


3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

READ specific person INPUT
OBTAIN specific person data
SHOW phone number

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.


function findEntry(array){
  let user = array.find(item => item.person == specificPerson);
console.log(user.phone);
}
var specificPerson="John Smith"
var phonebook=[{"person":"John Smith","phone":"323-3434"},{"person":"James Smith","phone":"445-2321"},{"person":"Sally Smith","phone":"123-4432"}];

console.log(findEntry(phonebook));
